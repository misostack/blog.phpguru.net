## Overview

ðŸ”¥ What is Kubernetes ðŸ”¥
â–º What problems does Kubernetes solve?
â–º What features do container orchestration tools offer?

### What Kubenertes is?

- Open source **Container Orchestration** Tool
- Developed by **Google**
- Helps you mange **containerized applications** in different **deployment environments**: physical, virtual machine, cloud, hybrid

### What problem does Kubenertes solve?

**1st problem: The need for a container orchestration tool**

- Trend from **Monolith** to **Microservices**
- Increased usage of **containers**
- Demand for a **proper way** of **managing** those hundreds of containers

### What features do container orchestration tools offer?

- **High Availability** or no downtime
- **Scalability** or high performance
- **Disater recovery** - backup and restore

## Introduction to K8s

### Kubenertes Components

**Pod**

- Smallest unit of K8s
- Abstraction over container
- Usually 1 application per Pod
- You can run multiple applications per Pod ( bad practice)
- Each pod gets its own IP Address
- New IP Address on re-recreation

Eg: your DB container died, then k8s auto re-create and replace the dead one but it use another IP Address.

## Advanced Concepts

### Master Node and Worker Node in Kubernetes

Overview

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/2b296865-7d7c-411b-bfe5-a67c57b228c7)

#### Worker Node

There are 3 processes in Worker Node

- Container Runtime ( can be docker )
- KubeProxy : Kind of virtual network
- Kubelet: connect node and container

#### Master Node

There are 4 processes in Master Node

- Api: cluster's gateway, gate keeper for authentication
- Scheduler: add/remove pods
- Controller Manager: detects cluster state changes
- ETCD: Cluster Brain, Key-Value Store

### Let's dive into practical excercises

#### Minikube

- A K8s Node in your local

#### Kubetl

- CLI Tool to interact with K8s API Server

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/487edd2d-9908-4b83-a6b9-9784e8597c0f)

You can use kubectl to interact with Cloud K8s Nodes

### Let's install them

#### Install kubectl

If in our computer, Docker Desktop had been installed already, just enable K8s

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/5b1e06c4-f5e4-4b86-961f-28989330f2ce)

If not, please follow k8s official doc to install on your appropriate os.

- [Install K8s tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

In this topic, i used MACOS, so here is the details

```sh
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/darwin/arm64/kubectl"
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
sudo chown root: /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version --client
```

When it is ready, you can test with this command line

```sh
kubectl cluster-info
```

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/8fd6095f-7407-4eaa-aae1-7fe862b088b1)

#### Install minikube

- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

The sample will be in MACOS

```sh
brew install minikube
# remove if you don't need it anymore
brew unlink minikube
brew link minikube
```

```sh
minikube start
```

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/46aebadc-060f-45fe-a632-719269040428)

When it's ready

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/31009750/64331a33-ff26-48f1-a660-2a2faba4c644)

Let's run some check commands

```sh
kubectl get nodes
# and you get
minhson@NBVN-KIENTC blog.phpguru.net % kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE    VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   3m4s   v1.28.3
minikube status
# and
minhson@NBVN-KIENTC blog.phpguru.net % minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

And with docker desktop, you may see this
