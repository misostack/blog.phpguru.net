## Overview

ðŸ”¥ What is Kubernetes ðŸ”¥
â–º What problems does Kubernetes solve?
â–º What features do container orchestration tools offer?

### What Kubenertes is?

- Open source **Container Orchestration** Tool
- Developed by **Google**
- Helps you mange **containerized applications** in different **deployment environments**: physical, virtual machine, cloud, hybrid

### What problem does Kubenertes solve?

**1st problem: The need for a container orchestration tool**

- Trend from **Monolith** to **Microservices**
- Increased usage of **containers**
- Demand for a **proper way** of **managing** those hundreds of containers

### What features do container orchestration tools offer?

- **High Availability** or no downtime
- **Scalability** or high performance
- **Disater recovery** - backup and restore

## Introduction to K8s

### Kubenertes Components

**Pod**

- Smallest unit of K8s
- Abstraction over container
- Usually 1 application per Pod
- You can run multiple applications per Pod ( bad practice)
- Each pod gets its own IP Address
- New IP Address on re-recreation

Eg: your DB container died, then k8s auto re-create and replace the dead one but it use another IP Address.
